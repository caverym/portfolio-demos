# Software Projects

A few of my public and open-source software projects. I spend most of my freetime during school or at home learning more about these programming languages and working on this software. I enjoy every moment of it.

## [proton caller](https://github.com/caverym/proton-caller)
A short program written in [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) which extends the usage of [Valve's Proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)) to any Windows program.

"Proton is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses Wine to facilitate this."<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>

Proton Caller has been featured here:
* [Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/394)
* [Reddit r/linux](https://reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lqqsut/)

## [cimplefetch](https://github.com/caverym/cimplefetch)
A very *cimple* fetch program, such as [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) using my own [libcimply](https://github.com/caverym/libcimply) C library. It has been successfully ported to MacOS too, missing just system uptime.

## [libcimply](https://github.com/caverym/libcimply)
An extremely basic library written in C which provides a struct with the user's account information on a [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) based OS.

## [rfetch](https://github.com/caverym/rfetch)
Based on [Cimplefetch](https://github.com/caverym/cimplefetch), does the same thing in the same way, but written in Rust instead.

## [My github.io page](https://github.com/caverym/caverym.github.io)
Not being software like the rest, I also have some experiance in basic web design, and digital design in general using my certification in [Adobe Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop).
